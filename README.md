# SQL PROJECT / Electric Vehicle Population Analyst
The data used in this SQL project is data that displays the number of electric vehicle users until 2024 in just one area, namely Washington, US. which displays the city, car brand, model year and so on

## Description
In this project, we use SQL to analyze some data to search such as the number of users in an area, brands and so on to answer several questions about the data that must be searched for to analyze and compare one with another.

## Installation
To run this project on your machine you need to install any SQL-supported DBMS then follow the steps below:

- Create a database.
- Create tables using the schema diagram provided below.
- Import csv files provided in the https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rizwanash/electric-vehicle-population-data/data.
